    <h2 id="C1">Literature Survey</h2>
    <p>As a plantation crop, brinjal is affected by many pests and diseases. Brinjal productivity is
    highly affected by those and the main constraint in disease and pest management is the lack
    of knowledge on identification and evaluation of the severity of diseases and pests. When
    considering the brinjal diseases and pests; Leafhopper damage, Hadda beetle and Red spider
    mite damage[2] is the most important to consider because leafhopper does the most
    impairment to the plant in Sri Lanka. The most obvious symptom of leafhopper feeding is
    hopper burn.Hopper burn is the yellowing of the leaf margin. This damage is followed by
    leaf curling and necrosis. Hopper burn occurs because leafhoppers feed by sucking the juices
    out of leaf veins and blocking the veins with a toxin in their saliva.
    Once hopper-burn is seen the plant has been damaged, which will either reduce yield or the
    quality of brinjal. Most of the brinjal farmers are not aware of pests eating patterns. In
    addition to that, delays in communication between farmers and agricultural specialists are
    another factor that hampers the effectiveness of the disease and pest management programs.
    Therefore, an efficient management system that provide farmer education while helping
    farmers to detect and identify diseases can be used to uplift the agriculture industry in Sri
    Lanka.</p>

      <b>Real-time detection of leaves available in a plants and classification of
      healthy and unhealthy (suspicious) leaflets.
     </b>
      
      Detect possible plant leaves and extract them separately from other objects using Yolov5
      object detection algorithm.
      Classify healthy and unhealthy (suspicious) leaflets from other leaves in the plant.
      Crop Segmenting (separating the background and cropping the region inside the bounding
      box) the suspicious leaflets separately from each finger in the plant. (Only the suspicious
      leaflets are extracted, others are disregarded) then provide those images for further
      classification to identify the disease.


      <br><br><b>Identify and classify the (Leafhopper damage, Hadda beetle and Red
      spider mite damage) using transfer learning based CNN models with high confidence scores.</b>
          
        Transfer learning based CNN is used to classify the disease. Various CNN architectures
        are used to compare and find the best fit architecture. The accuracy of each architecture's
        result is compared, and the best one is chosen to train the model to identify diseases.
         Multi-Class Image Classification techniques are used to classify diseases based on their
        eating patterns.        
         The custom image set will be pre-processed to reduce image sample similarities and to
        avoid model over and underfitting.
         Layers of the CNN architecture will be altered (dropped and frozen) according to get a
        good fit model.


      <br><br><b>Identify the severity level of infection or stage of the detected disease
      using Mask R-CNN.</b>
     The crop segmented leaf image is further processed to determine the severity level of
    infection or stage of the detected disease by calculating the ratio of total leaf area to infected
    portion.
     The factors which determine the severity/stage of the disease are analyzed. It can be the
    portion of the area it has spread, or the color texture changes in the leaf.
     The masked area is extracted from the image. Color segmentation is used to group different
    color pigments present in the image in order to distinguish between healthy and diseased
    pigments.
     The K-means clustering algorithm is used to calculate the percentage of damage by
    calculating the ratio between the colors (which were clustered using color segmentation).



      <br><br><b>Manual recognition of diseases using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
      with the help of Facebook posts.</b>
     It can be difficult to predict the disease with high confidence all of the time. Users can seek
    assistance from the community if the identified disease or pest has a low confidence score
    using a Facebook post
     Users can click on a buttons after the disease is identified so that the disease images along
    with a question will be posted on Facebook as a post.
     Experts, farmers, and other agricultural professionals in the group can leave comments on
    the post. They can provide feedback on whether or not the disease has been correctly
    identified.
     Using NLP, the most frequently occurring world will be extracted and analyzed to
    determine whether the prediction is correct or not. If not, the community-suggested disease
    will be sent to the application.

    <h2 id="S3">Research Problem</h2>
    <p>Since ancient times, Sri Lanka has been an agricultural country. The agricultural sector will
    contribute 7.8 percent of the gross national product by 2021. Agriculture employs more than
    a quarter of all Sri Lankans. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic in 2019, most citizens turned to
    gardening, and now, due to the nation's dollar crisis and high prices of goods, citizens have
    turned to gardening even more. Although Sri Lanka is a fertile tropical country with the
    potential to grow and process a wide range of crops, issues such as productivity, knowledge,
    and profitability are impeding the sector's growth.
    A big problem for the farmers, as well as the common people, is that they do not have proper
    knowledge about farming, so the productivity of the crops is reduced and the crops are
    destroyed due to the inability to identify the diseases affecting the respective crops. Due to
    the prevailing situation in the country, it is always difficult to meet the agriculture officials,
    so they have no other way to get knowledge about it. These problems discourage gardeners
    and farmers from cultivating.
    Sri Lanka has a large number of plants used for Gardening as well as industries Among them,
    when we consider the brinjal crop, we can identify the damages caused to it as follows.
    Solanum species (eggplants) belong to the family of Solanaceae and genus Solanum, with
    over 1,000 species worldwide. Eggplant or brinjal (solanum melongina) is a well-known
    vegetable in local and world markets. The world's annual brinjal production is approximately
    43, 173,989 MT and the area under brinjal cultivation is 1,728,271ha. There are six main
    varieties of brinjal in Sri Lanka. They are Amanda F1, Anjalee-F1, HORDI Lenairi 1,
    Thinnaweli purple, Padagoda, and SM 164. Badulla, Hambantota, and Anuradhapura are the
    major brinjal cultivating areas in Sri Lanka. The Total extent of brinjal under cultivation in
    Sri Lanka is about 9,665 ha with a total production of about 108,856 t and an average yield
    of about 11.26 t/ha (AgStat, 2018).
    As a plantation crop, brinjal is affected by many pests and diseases. Brinjal productivity is
    highly affected by those and the main constraint in disease and pest management is the lack
    of knowledge on identification and evaluation of the severity of diseases and pests. When
    considering the brinjal diseases and pests; Leafhopper damage, Hadda beetle and Red spider
    mite damage[2] is the most important to consider because leafhopper does the most
    impairment to the plant in Sri Lanka. The most obvious symptom of leafhopper feeding is
    hopper burn.Hopper burn is the yellowing of the leaf margin. This damage is followed by
    leaf curling and necrosis. Hopper burn occurs because leafhoppers feed by sucking the juices
    out of leaf veins and blocking the veins with a toxin in their saliva.Once hopper-burn is seen the plant has been damaged, which will either reduce yield or the
    quality of brinjal. Most of the brinjal farmers are not aware of pests eating patterns. In
    addition to that, delays in communication between farmers and agricultural specialists are
    another factor that hampers the effectiveness of the disease and pest management programs.
    Therefore, an efficient management system that provide farmer education while helping
    farmers to detect and identify diseases can be used to uplift the agriculture industry in Sri
    Lanka.

      <br><br>
      
    
    </p>
    
    <br><br>
    <h2 id="S5">Methodology</h2><p>
      This study proposes a mobile application to learn about
      farming and identify the disease by capturing an image of a
      plant. All of the leafs are detected separately and classified
      as healthy or unhealthy (suspicious) using techniques
      (YOLO). Only the suspicious leafs are extracted using crop
      segmentation and sent through Convolutional Neural
      Network (CNN) models to clearly classify and distinguish
      the diseases using feature extraction. The system will
      identify and classify the diseases, as well as provide aconfidence score for the detection. Once the leaf is identified
      to be infected, the images will go through the Mask-R-CNN
      model to determine the progression level of the disease
      according to severity levels.
      Users can seek assistance from the community if the
      identified disease or pest has a low confidence score. A post
      about the disease will be published in a Facebook group run
      by agricultural experts and farmers. Their comments on the
      post will be filtered. The most frequently suggested disease
      will be sorted and displayed in the app. This can be achieved
      using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The results of
      the ML models can be further validated by checking with the
      answers of the experts.
